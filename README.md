### Build an application in React that tracks inventory for a local business. We're going to keep this simple: you'll pick one inventory item and track how much of it is remaining as it gets sold or given away. There are a lot of themes to choose from, and you can create your own as long as you're able to track the remaining amount of an inventory item and meet the objectives.
